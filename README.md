# D3-Challenge

This project uses D3 to create a dynamic graph of  % of state population in poverty and median household income vs % lacking healthcare in that state.   The user can select the desired value for the x-axis and the graph is redrawn to display that dataset.  Each state is marked with a circle filled with the state abbreviation.
